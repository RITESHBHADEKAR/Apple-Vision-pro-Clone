          Our most advanced <br />
          Spatial Audio system ever.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Dual-driver audio pods positioned next to each ear deliver
          personalized sound while letting you hear what’s around you. Spatial
          Audio makes sounds feel like they’re coming from your surroundings.
          Audio ray tracing analyzes your room’s acoustic properties to adapt
          and match sound to your space. And if you want to use headphones with
          Apple Vision Pro, the new AirPods Pro (2nd generation) with USB‑C
          offer the perfect experience, featuring Lossless Audio with ultra-low
          latency enabled by the H2 chip in both devices.
